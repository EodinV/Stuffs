Wind cools, or really, air absorbs heat and wind helps transfer heat by circulating air.
measuring temperatures in different directions around a cylinder should make it possible to 
determine where the airflow is highest and therefore 
pinpoint the wind direction...

as a secondary, with added information (air pressure and humidity as well as "still temperature")
the wind speed may be calculable, but this might fall on the sensitivity of the termistors.
